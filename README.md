This project is a replica of the famous amazon ecommerce website.

It is built using Nextjs and SanityCMS. 

I chose Nextjs for this project because it handles api request in-house, meaning I don't have to install a backend framework like "ExpressJS" for this, also, with Nextjs, I had the advantage of fast Web page loads in comparison to ReactJS which offers client side rendering. 

Lastly, Nextjs is a full stack React framework. 

Nextjs is a React framework and Sanity is a headless CMS. The word CMS stands for Content Management System.

A content management system is a software whose main responsibility is that of creating and managing digital content.

In addition, this project also uses PayPal via the npm package "@paypal/react-paypal-js" to handle payments to products by customers.

Each checkout is authenticated, meaning, a customer must first register themselves before they can purchase any products.
